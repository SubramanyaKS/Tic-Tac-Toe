# Tic-Tac-Toe

A simple Tic-Tac-Toe game using react JS contains both player vs player and player vs computer.

Tic-tac-toe or Xs and Os is a paper-and-pencil game for two players who take turns marking the spaces in a three-by-three grid with X or O. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner. It is a solved game, with a forced draw assuming best play from both players.
